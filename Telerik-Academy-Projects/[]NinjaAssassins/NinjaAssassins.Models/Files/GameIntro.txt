Once upon a time there was a peaceful place, where very well- 

trained ninjas lived. But some of them became evil and began

killing innocent gamers. They called themselves the NINJA ASSASSINS.

The last of the remaining good ninjas - Nick, Doni, Ivo and E.C. 
 
swore to protect the gamers. We called them the GREEN NINJAS. 

Unfortunately, they can`t save everyone and the gamers must help 

themselves... 



	 	             You may survive... OR NOT! 

		            ONLY ONE IS THE LUCKY WINNER!
