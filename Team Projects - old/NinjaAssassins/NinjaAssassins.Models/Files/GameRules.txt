  Game Win Logic:
  
  Survive The Ninja Assassin by using the other cards as ways to survive.
  
  Rules:
  
  A deck of 32 cards (4 of each kind) is placed on the board. You and 3 other players take 
  turns to draw a card. Each card has a different action:
  
  1. Ninja Assassin (deadly type) – kills you instantly, unless you have a card of the saviour type.
  2. Green Ninja (saviour type) – saves your life.
  3. Fight (saviour type) – you get a 50/50 chance to survive by playing a Fight card.
  4. Escape (saviour type) – draw another card from the deck. If it’s a saviour type – you’re not done yet.
  5. Hide (saviour type) – use this card and try to hide behind the next player in turn. If they have a Green 
  Ninja in their hand, you’re saved and the player skips a turn in return. If not – bye, bye!
  6. Attack – attack the next player in turn – make them draw two cards instead of one.
  7. Skip Turn - use this card and skip your next turn to draw.
  8. Shuffle the deck and confuse all the Ninja Assassins.
  
  If the drawn card is not a Ninja Assassin, you decide whether to play it or hold on to it and play it later 
  in the game. A player can hold up to 3 cards in their hand. But beware! At the end of the game, your score 
  gets decreased with the rank of each card you hold. If you have 3 cards in your hand, the next time you draw 
  one, you have to either play it, or play one of the other three in your hand. If you draw a Ninja Assassin – 
  you either die or use one of the saviour types of cards (if you have any) to try and survive. Scoring depends 
  on each played card rank. In the end, if you’re not dead – the player with the highest score wins.
